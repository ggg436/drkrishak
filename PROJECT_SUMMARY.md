# Eco-Friendly Farming Social Platform

## Project Summary

This project is a social platform for eco-friendly farming, focusing on sustainable agricultural practices and community building. The platform allows users to share posts, interact with other farmers, and access a marketplace for eco-friendly products.

## Recent Changes

We have migrated the authentication system from Supabase to Clerk and the database from Supabase to Neon PostgreSQL. Due to package installation issues in the development environment, we created mock implementations for both services:

1. **Mock Clerk Authentication** (`src/lib/clerk-mock.ts` and `src/lib/clerk-components.tsx`)
   - Simulates user authentication with localStorage persistence
   - Provides components like SignIn, SignUp, and UserButton
   - Maintains the same API interface as the real Clerk service

2. **Mock Neon Database** (`src/lib/db-mock.ts`)
   - Provides a SQL-like query interface with localStorage for data persistence
   - Supports operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
   - Maintains the same API interface as the real pg module

3. **Updated Components**
   - `ClerkAuthProvider.tsx` now uses the mock Clerk implementation
   - `UserContext.tsx` handles user authentication and management
   - `postService.ts` uses the mock database for post operations
   - `main.tsx` incorporates the new authentication flow

4. **Configuration**
   - Updated Vite configuration to handle the pg module in the browser

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub Repository**
   - Repository: https://github.com/ggg436/earth-friendly-frontpage-now.git
   - Follow the instructions in GITHUB_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md

2. **Complete the Migration**
   - Install the real Clerk and pg packages in the production environment
   - Configure the real services using the same API interfaces
   - Test the application with real authentication and database

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Implement more features for the eco-friendly farming community
   - Add analytics and reporting capabilities
   - Enhance the marketplace functionality
