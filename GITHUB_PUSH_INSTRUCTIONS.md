# Instructions for Pushing Code to GitHub

Since we're experiencing issues with the terminal in this environment, here are manual instructions to push your code to GitHub:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't have it already
2. Clone the repository from GitHub: `https://github.com/ggg436/earth-friendly-frontpage-now.git`
3. Copy all the files from your local project to the cloned repository folder
4. Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push the changes

## Option 2: Using Git Command Line

1. Open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window (outside of this environment)
2. Navigate to your project directory: `cd "D:\mahesh\project-bolt-sb1-3rpagra1 (1)\project"`
3. Initialize Git if not already initialized: `git init`
4. Add the remote repository: `git remote add origin https://github.com/ggg436/earth-friendly-frontpage-now.git`
5. Add all files: `git add .`
6. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Migrate from Supabase to Clerk and Neon PostgreSQL with mock implementations"`
7. Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin main` (or `git push -u origin master` depending on your default branch name)
8. When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials or use a Personal Access Token

## Option 3: Upload ZIP File to GitHub

1. Create a ZIP file of your project folder
2. Go to https://github.com/ggg436/earth-friendly-frontpage-now
3. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
4. Drag and drop the ZIP file or browse to select it
5. Add a commit message and commit the changes

## Note

If you encounter authentication issues, you might need to create a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token
2. Give it a name, set an expiration, and select the "repo" scope
3. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub
